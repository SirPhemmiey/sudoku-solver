### Things i would have done
 - Written most tests
 - Dockerize the service
 - Use Dependency injection properly 
 - Split out some of the private methods into a helper class
 - Build a UI for the API because that's when the beauty of the game will be seen. (i.e persisting the moves and visually seeing the values after every play)
